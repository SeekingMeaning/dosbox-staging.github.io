## 1. Summary

TODO

## 2. New Features in Detail

### Improve --editconf, --printconf options

Sometimes it's hard to determine the location of `dosbox-staging.conf` file -
user might not know the location or sandboxed package (e.g. Snap package)
stores the configuration files in some hidden location.

These two options help user find/edit the file:

- `dosbox --editconf` - open the default .conf file in a text editor.

  This option respects `EDITOR` environment variable. If user did not select
preferred editor, then one of the following ones will be used:
`nano`, `vim`, `vi`, `notepad++.exe`, `notepad.exe`.

- `dosbox --printconf` - print .conf file path to the standard output.


### Add LS command

TODO describe for non-technical users

```
commit a767145a2862e1552bc842a623df085470efb7b7
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 22 19:31:28 2020 +0200

    Rudimentary ls implementation
    
    This is not supposed to be fully-featured ls command, as GNU ls, only a
    quick replacement for ls to make output more readable.
    
    Simply list all files, the same way DIR command does, except for
    formatting and skipping most switches. Store listing in a temporary
    vector (the same way DIR does), in case we'll want to implement sorting
    flags in the future.
    
    Use uppercase for directories and lowercase for files (same way Norton
    Commander differentiates between files and directories). Use blue colour
    for directories (the same way GNU ls does by default).
```


### Rapid DC-offset correction for the emulated PC speaker

Audio speakers work by pushing and pulling their diaphram at a rate
equal to the frequency of the audio being played.

Physical PC speakers can sometimes be left in a pushed-out or pulled-in
state through constant voltage, called DC-offset. DC offset in a real
PC speaker typically isn't a problem because it will remain silent in
an offset state.

However in DOSBox, the emulated PC speaker's audio samples are mixed
with those from the other emulated audio devices, such as the Sound
Blaster or Adlib. Eliminating DC-offset is important in because it
can:

- cause a pop if the next sample played has a value signficantly
different from the position of the DC-offset
- harm accurate sound reproduction of other sound devices by moving
half their samples either further away from the center line (becoming
louder) and the other half of the samples closer to the center line
(becoming quieter).

This new configuration option, `zero_offset` under the `[speaker]`
section, defaults to `'auto'`. It's enables for non-Windows systems
and  disables it on Windows as some Windows drivers appear to
attempt their own DC offset correction.

For visuals and more detail about this change, see:
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/480

For a discussion about Windows 10 performing DC-offset correction,
see: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/625


### Dynamic recompilation for PowerPC and POWER8 (ppc64le)

TODO describe for non-technical users
TODO notify author of ppc64le patch!


### Audio pop and click improvements

Two changes have been made to reduce the occurence of audio pops and
clicks on game startup, as follows:

- Initial audio by all emulated devices is fed through an 15-ms
  envelope specifically timed to prevent unnatural electronic pops and
  clicks, yet fast enough to ensure that sharp-attack natural sounds
  (such as a symbol crash) are not affected.

  For visuals and detail about the enveloper, see:
  https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/442

- Some games test their interface to the Sound Blaster 16 using one or
  more small "junk" DMA transfers. Unfortunately on actual hardware,
  this results in startup clicks and pops, which can be jarring when
  using a headset.  These initial junk transfers are now suppressed.

  For visuals and detail about DMA suppression, see: 
  https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/411


### Gravis UltraSound (GUS) improvements

Several changes have been made to the GUS emulation resulting in (sometimes)
audible difference, as follows:

- Output levels are now typically on-par with other audio devices.
- Panning of voices is performed using constant-power, as described in the
  Gravis' documentation and originally researched by the British
  Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
- When quiting dosbox, information about GUS audio stream will be provided,
  such as the breakdown of 8-bit versus 16-bit samples. A potential suggestion
  to adjust the game's GUS mixer level, either upward or downward may also be
  provided, which you could paste into your game's startup batch file or
  `[autoexec]` section.

We recommend using GUS emulation for the handful of DOS games that natively
support the GUS's multi-voice feature. For a list of these games, see:
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Gravis-Ultrasound-(GUS)

For more details about DOSBox Staging's GUS enhancements, see:
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/Gravis-UltraSound-Enhancements

For information about constant power panning from the BBC, see pages 7 and 8:
http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP051.pdf


### Add an option for skipping the splash screen

The splash screen can now be skipped through a new configuration option
called `startup_verbosity` in the `[dosbox]` section.

When set to `high`, the slash screen, blue help block, and any of
dosbox's initial console output will be shown.

When set to `medium`, the slash screen is skipped, but the blue help
block and any of dosbox's initial console output will be shown.

When set to `low`, the slash screen and blue help block will be skipped,
but any of dosbox's initial console output will be shown.

When set to `quiet`, all of the above will be skipped. The first output
will either be the command prompt or output from startup executables.

By default, the verbosity it set to `auto`, which is equal to `low` when
an executable or directory is passed on the commandline. Otherwise `auto`
is equal to `high` when DOSBox Staging is started without initial commands.

For a visual depiction of the options, see:
- https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/477

GUS improvements
TODO Many commits and PRs


### Add pixel-perfect option when using OpenGL output

TODO describe for non-technical users
openglpp was supposed to be temporary, but we'll deprecate it in 0.77.0
TODO showcase pixel-perfect + resizable window

```
    Add openglpp option

    It's a temporary; should be supported as hidden, "deprecated"
    option; other forks provide it as an option, so we need to handle it
    (with a warning) but we shouldn't advertise it to the users.
```


### Add FluidSynth support

TODO describe for non-technical users

### Improve Telnet-mode handling for Modem emulation

For those hosting a BBS being a Telnet interface, you can now
pre-configure your serial port in Telnet-mode with the `telnet:1`
argument, as follows:


``` ini
[serial]
serial1 = modem telnet:1 listenport:2323
```

For those dialing BBSs hosted behind a Telnet interface, use the
following dial-prefix: `AT+NET1DT`. In general, the `+NET1` or `+NET0`
AT-command will enable or disable Telnet-mode, respectively.

This change bring Telnet-mode control in-line with the Hayes multi-character
command specification, which should be compatible with existing BBS software.

For more background about this change, see:
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/582


### Add an option for setting monochrome palette colour

Mention, that it was backported to 0.75.2 already?


### Properly set modify time on written files

```
    Properly set modify time on written files

    Implements the missing part of DOS function 57h which sets modify time
    on a file. Previously, it was a stub.
    "copy" command now copies over file modify time as well.

    This should fix some install programs which check file modify dates.

    Code taken from this patch ripped from ykhwong's fork by gulikoza:
    https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=22600
```

### Raw mouse input

Mention, that it was backported to 0.75.2 already?

7bb013a021b0f376df169478bf81c1702bbafb6a


### Raw mouse input

Add dosbox --help -h command option.

Perhaps merge with mount/imgmount help?


### Case-insensitive paths handling

For mount, imgmount commands.

```
commit 1f03e0fec9c0e0a4b614c1990f5bec1612c4ebda
Author: Patryk Obara <dreamer.tan@gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 17 19:59:04 2020 +0200

    Treat imgmount input path as case-insensitive
    
    Add more logs, so it should be easier for users to figure out what is
    happening when the imgmount command can't find the file.
    
    This change is required to make the .conf files cross-platform. It's
    usual practice for DOS packagers and distributors to write imgmount
    commands expecting case-insensitive filesystem and Windows path
    separators.
    
    DOSBox already does various path conversions to accomodate e.g. switching
    directory separators or even checks if path can't be loaded as
    case-insensitive when relative to virtual DOS drive.
```


### Revise default keyboard shortcuts

TODO describe for non-technical users

- **Alt-Enter** - Switch between fullscreen and window mode.
- **Alt-Pause** - Pause/Unpause emulator.
- **Ctrl-F1** - Start the keymapper.
- **Ctrl-F4** - Change between mounted floppy/CD images.
- **Ctrl-F5** - Save a screenshot.
- **Ctrl-F6** - Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.
- **Ctrl-F7** - Start/Stop recording video output to a zmbv file.
- **Ctrl-F9** - Shutdown emulator.
- **Ctrl-F10** - Capture/Release the mouse.
- **Ctrl-F11** - Slow down emulation.
- **Ctrl-F12** - Speed up emulation.
- **Ctrl-Alt-Home** - Restart emulator.
- hold **Alt-F12** - Fast forward.

Keymapper received tiny usabity improvements as well: it displays
keyboard shortcut (binding) for selected action.
