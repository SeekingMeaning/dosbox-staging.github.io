## Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers
and testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#development-snapshot-builds).


## Building from source

Of course you can always [build dosbox-staging straight from the source][1].
Send us patches if you improve something! :)
