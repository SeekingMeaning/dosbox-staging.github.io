## Tarball download

TODO: **RC1 build not released yet**
<!-- **[Download dosbox-staging 0.75.0-rc1](/)** -->

Our precompiled tarball builds are designed to work with wide range
of Linux distributions (x86\_64 only for now), but will require you
to manually install some dependencies in order to use it:

#### Fedora

    sudo dnf install SDL2 SDL2_net opusfile

#### Debian (10 or newer), Ubuntu (18.04 LTS or newer)

    sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0 libsdl2-net-2.0 libopusfile0

#### Arch, Manjaro

    sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_net opusfile


## Development snapshot builds

You can always check what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable, they are designed with developers
and testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](
