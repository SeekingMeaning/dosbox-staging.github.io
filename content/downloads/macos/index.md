[dmg]: https://TODO

Compatible only with macOS 10.15 (Catalina).

If you want to run it on an older macOS,
[build dosbox-staging yourself straight from the source][1].
Send us patches if you improve something! :)

*macOS uses its Gatekeeper feature to prevent users from running
externally-hosted 3rd party software, such as dosbox-staging. See [the section
below](#apple-gatekeeper) to learn how to fix it.*

### Development snapshot builds

You can always see what's cooking on the master branch :)

These builds might be slow or unstable as they are designed with developers and
testers in mind: [download instructions for snapshot builds](
https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#development-snapshot-builds).

### <a name="apple-gatekeeper"></a> Apple Gatekeeper

Apple's Gatekeeper feature only permits the running of notarized software, one
aspect of which involves developers making yearly payments to Apple.

As dosbox-staging is a volunteer effort, we are not in a position to make such
payments and therefore ask users to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper using either of
the following methods:

#### Method 1

Use Linux instead. [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) is an excellent
choice for new users.

#### Method 2

**Ctrl-click** (or right-click) on dosbox-staging app, and select "Open".
This time, Gatekeeper will show "Open" button like on a screenshot below:
