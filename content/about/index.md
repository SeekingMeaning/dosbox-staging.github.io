**dosbox-staging** is an attempt at revitalization of development
process for DOSBox emulator.  It is not a rewrite, but continuation
and improvement on existing codebase, leveraging current development
tools and practices.

This project is **separate** from "vanilla" [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)
project developed by DOSBox Team.

## Goals

- Enable **new contributors**, remove barriers to entry.
- Fix, cleanup, and merge a number of **community-developed patches**,
  that were not accepted upstream.
- Implement **new features** and quality of life improvements.
- Provide good **out of the box** experience for new users.
- Focus on **DOS games** (but we welcome improvements for productivity software as
  long as they do not regress game emulation quality)
- Balancing emulation **quality** with **speed** and **usability**.
- Deliver consistent cross-platform experience.
- Leverage ongoing DOSBox development.
- Focus on supporting up-to-date, current Operating Systems and modern
  hardware.

You can read a bit more about differences from developer POV
[here](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging#summary-of-differences-compared-to-upstream).

Planned features can be followed through
[the backlog](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/projects/3).

## Non-goals

- Development focused on retro-computing - users, who want
  DOS emulator on older platforms like Windows 9x, OS/2, or Mac OS X 10.4
  should stick to [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/).
- Perfect hardware emulation - there are other emulators focusing
  on this goal, such as [PCem](https://pcem-emulator.co.uk/) or
  [DOSBox-X](https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x).
- Being the fastest DOS emulator for x86 architecture - users interested in
  emulation speed should look at [dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2).
- Running DOS as daily driver / OS. There's [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/).
