**dosbox-staging** is a [soft-fork][1] of DOSBox (which is a separate project, with
its own schedule and development priorities).  We acknowledge and are thankful
for the work shared by all DOSBox contributors.  Changes originating from
DOSBox are clearly marked as "SVN".

This changelog is quite massive, so we split it into several sections:

1. [New features and improvements (for users)](#new-features)
2. [New features and improvements (for testers and developers)](#devel-features)
3. [Changelog (dosbox-staging)](#changelog-git)
4. [Changelog (DOSBox SVN)](#changelog-svn)
