## <a name="overview" href="#introduction">§</a> Overview of Changes

The **dosbox-staging 0.75** development cycle lasted roughly eight months
starting with the creation of the project mid-September 2019 and concluded
early May 2020.

### <a name="summary-new-features" href="#summary-new-features">§</a> Summary of New Features

- Migrated from Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) version 1.2.x to 2.0, which:
  - Enabled support for the Wayland display protocols
  - Enabled hardware-acceleration for OpenGL ES 1 and 2 devices on ARM
    platforms.
- Added support for CD-ROM Digital Audio (CD-DA) tracks compressed using the
  Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), Opus, and Moving Picture Experts Group
  (MPEG) 2 Audio Layer III (MP3) audio codecs.
- Added hardware-accelerated pixel-perfect output.
- Added the ability to resize the window.
- Added the cycle-accurate Nuked Operator Type-L 3 (OPL3) emulator.
- Added Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) mono-color mode.
- Added phonebook support, to map modem phone-numbers to Internet hostnames.
- Added the AUTOTYPE command, which can perform scripted keyboard input on your
  behalf.

These are expanded upon in the following subsections.

### <a name="removed" href="#removed">§</a> Removed Features

- dosbox-staging does not run on Operating System/2 (OS/2) or derivatives.
- dosbox-staging does not run on Windows older than XP.
- Removed support for old DirectDraw (`ddraw`) output.  
  Use `output = texture`, `texture_renderer = directx11` instead.
- Removed support for old `overlay` output. Use any other output.
- Removed support for relative window size (`windowresolution = X%`).
- Removed support for 64-bit Zip Motion Blocks Video (ZMBV) codec (old 32-bit
  codec still works).
- Removed support for CD-DA playback from physical disks. It is
  still possible to install games distributed on CDs by mounting them as
  directories. See [#260][260].
- Removed CD-DA playback support for tracks using the Audio Interchange File
  Format[AIFF][aiff] audio codec.

### <a name="developer-features" href="#developer-features">§</a> Developmental Changes

- Migrated the DOSBox source from Apache's Subversion (SVN) software versioning
  and revision control system to the Git distributed version-control system
  using GitHub, while preserving all publicly available project history.
  - Active SVN branch paths were imported as Git branches (named`svn/<name>`).
  - SVN tag paths were imported as Git lightweight tags (named
    `svn/<tag-name>`).
- Ongoing upstream SVN development work is being imported in a timely manner to
  the Git branch named `svn/trunk`.
- Began the migration to and allowance for C++11 language constructs.
- Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) system that builds on every code
  push to provide immediate feedback to developers regarding build-success and
  warning-counts on:
  - Windows x86_64 using GCC 32 and 64-bit, Clang 32 and 64-bit, and
    VisualStudio 64-bit compilers
  - macOS x86_64 using GCC and Clang compilers
  - Linux x86_64, ARMv6, ARMv7, IBM LinuxONE, and IBM POWER8 platforms using
    various versions of GCC and Clang
- Added static analysis checks performed by LLVM's Clang, Synopsys's Coverity,
  and VIVA64's Program Verification Systems (PVS) Studio.
- Added dynamic analysis checks performed by Clang's undefined-behavior (UB)
  sanitizer and GCC's UB and Address sanitizers.
- The CI system includes gated checks that allow maintainers to focus on code
  functionality and correctness. These automated checks guarantee that new
  code:
  - builds clean on all supported platforms and compilers,
  - adds no new compiler warnings, and
  - adds no new static or dynamic analysis issues.
- Notable progress has been made in reducing the number of warnings and
  analysis issues flagged by these tools.
- *Windows*: the build-system was adjusted to allow easy compilation, without
  manual download or patching of dependencies. We use `vcpkg` to manage
  dependencies. The solution file was fixed to work with Visual Studio 2019.
- *Linux and macOS*: implemented a number of small build-system improvements.
- Automated the compilation of release-style builds against the latest master
  and feature branches. These not only save time for testers wanting to verify
  new features and bugfixes, but also ensures they're running builds compiled
  using would-be release settings.
- *macOS*: release binaries are compiled with optimizations supporting Intel
  Nehalem-based instructions (and newer), as this matches the minimum processor
  requirements set by macOS Catalina.
- Release packages are scanned using up-to-date Antivirus software: ClamAV for
  Linux and macOS, and Windows Defender for Windows.
- The project has published a Code of Conduct along with clear Contributor
  Guidelines.

### <a name="known-issues" href="#known-issues">§</a> Known issues

- Inconsistent minimum window size with `windowresolution = resizable` when
  leaving fullscreen.
- Windows, macOS: Window content is not refreshed when resizing.
- Windows, macOS: Emulation stops when moving or resizing window.
- Linux: Wayland crashes (Wayland support is "experimental" at the moment)
- Linux: Splash screen is sometimes transparent or corrupted on KDE

We are extremely grateful for all contributions including the invaluable
improvements merged in from the DOSBox project. Thank you!

## <a name="new-features" href="#new-features">§</a> New Features in Detail

### <a name="sdl2" href="#sdl2">§</a> Upgrade to SDL 2.0

SDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase, which has been unmaintained
since 2013. SDL 2.0 supports more input devices; more output interfaces such as
Wayland, and OpenGLES 1 and 2; low-latency audio using OpenSL ES; and improves
cross-platform consistency.

The migration to SDL 2.0:

- dropped 3,211 lines of SDL 1.2 code in place of 1,664 lines, for just
  under a 50% reduction in code-size.
- eliminated several OS-specific branches and all SDL1-specific kludges.
- eased support for modern graphic APIs, and opened the field for new features
  and improvements.

One example includes the new `texture` `output` mode, which uses SDL's 2D
hardware-accelerated API rendering to a platform-specific backend.

For example, Windows users can use:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = direct3d11
```

macOS users can try Metal:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = metal
```

and everyone can use OpenGL as texture backend:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = opengl
```

Or just use `texture_renderer = auto` to let SDL pick the backend appropriate
for your Operating System.

## <a name="cdda" href="#cdda">§</a> Support FLAC, Opus, and MP3 CD-DA tracks

FLAC, Opus, and MP3 (as well as MP2 and MP1)-encoded audio can be `imgmount`ed
as CD-DA tracks in dosbox-staging, in addition to the usual WAV and Vorbis
tracks supported by DOSBox. WAV support has been expanded to include Sony's
Wave64 format.

dosbox-staging also support the use of various sample esolutions, such as 24
and 16-bit; sampling rates, such as 96, 88.2, 48, 44.1, 22.05, and 11.025 kHz;
and stereo or mono channel counts, to the extent supported by the codecs
themselves. You can mix-and-match these among your tracks to tailor your
encoding settings to the track's content.

The following example CUE file depicts the use of all codecs:

``` cue
FILE "data.iso" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2048
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track02.opus" OPUS
  TRACK 02  AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track03.flac" FLAC
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track04.mp3" MP3
  TRACK 04 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track05.w64" W64
  TRACK 05 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track06.ogg" OGG
  TRACK 06 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track07.wav" WAV
  TRACK 07 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

For devices with sufficient storage, we recommend ripping your CD-ROM audio to
(lossless) FLAC tracks and adding seek-points using:

``` shell
flac -8 --output-name=trackXY.flac trackXY.wav
metaflac --add-seekpoint=1s trackXY.flac
```

FLAC can provide up to 50% compression and no loss of fidelity.

For limited-storage devices such as ARM single-board computers, Opus provides
state-of-the-art lossy compression that exceeds all other formats including
Apple's AAC and AAC High-Efficiency formats. Opus allows you to save almost
twice as much space versus MP3 or Vorbis.

For example, CD-DA tracks consisting of monaural speech can be encoded with:

``` shell
opusenc --speech --bitrate 24 --downmix-mono trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

Jones in the Fast Lane's CD-DA audio track (in WAV format) compresses from 373
MB to 6.4 MB, with no discernible quality loss.

A bitrate between 54 and 70 is sufficient for sound effects and simple music,
while a bitrate of 84 can be used for more complex musical tracks. Experiment
and find your sweet spot!

``` shell
opusenc --bitrate 70 trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

If your CD-DA tracks are encoded at 48 kHz (which is Opus's default internal
rate), then feel free to configure `dosbox-staging`'s mixer rate to match,
which ensures your CD-DA will not be resampled through your audio chain; as
your sound card, USB speakers, and HDMI interface all (likely) operate at a
native rate of 48 kHz.

``` ini
[mixer]
rate = 48000
```

### <a name="pp" href="#pp">§</a> Pixel-perfect scaling mode

Pixel-perfect output scales the image by the largest integer multiplier
that fits within your monitor's native resolution. For example, given a
1920x1080 monitor and a game requiring aspect-correction, each
of its 320x200 pixels would be scaled by 4x5 to produce a
1280x1000 image. This preserves the original artwork without *any* edge
blurring.

To enable pixel-perfect output, apply the following settings to the
indicated `[section]`s of your dosbox-staging configuration file, as
follows:

``` ini
[sdl]
fullscreen = true
output     = texturepp

[render]
scaler   = none
glshader = none
```

Pixel-perfect looks like this on a 1080p screen:

[![HoMM2](/homm2-pp-2x2-min.png)][homm2pp]

Heroes of Might and Magic 2 (1996)

Wolfenstein 3D (1992)  
320x200 with a PAR of 1:1.2 (non-square pixels), upscaled to 4x5 with a PAR of 1:1.25

[par]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_aspect_ratio
[homm2pp]: /homm2-pp-2x2.png
[wolf3dpp]: /wolf3d-pp-4x5.png

### <a name="resizable" href="#resizable">§</a> Resizable window

Being able to click and drag to resize an application's window is not a
revolutionary feature by any measure, however it's a welcome addition for
`dosbox-staging`!

{{ youtube(id="9J2U-qFxE1E", class="youtube") }}

This feature is a work-in-progress: it's available on Linux by default, and can
be enabled for testing on Windows and macOS by setting the following (but note
that it does not yet work correctly on these systems):

``` ini
[sdl]
windowresolution = resizable
```

On all systems, the resizable window is only available for `output = opengl`
and `glshader = sharp`. Support will be expanded to more outputs and shaders in
the future versions.

### <a name="autotype" href="#autotype">§</a> AUTOTYPE command

`AUTOTYPE` is a command-line tool provided by `dosbox-staging` that performs
scripted keyboard entry into the running DOS program or game.

It can be used to reliably skip intros, provide input to answer initial startup
or configuration questions, or conduct a simple demo.

Simply run the command to learn more:

``` shell
Z:> autotype
```

A list of games that benefit from AUTOTYPE on startup are listed on this [wiki page][autotype].

[autotype]: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/AUTOTYPE-Candidates

### <a name="rdef" href="#rdef">§</a> Changed rendering defaults

The following default configuration settings were changed to improve the
out-of-the box experience for the majority of games running on modern hardware.

The default video settings now use SDL's OpenGL rendering backend, apply a 4:3
aspect ratio correction, and scale the image using the `sharp` OpenGL shader to
provide relatively sharp pixels when in fullscreen-mode.

[![Battle Chess](/bc.png)](/bc.png)

### <a name="mouse" href="#mouse">§</a> Expand mouse control methods

The prior "autolocking" mouse option used by DOSBox has been renamed in
dosbox-staging to `capture_mouse`, which is configured using two values
defining how the mouse behaves.

The first value defines how the mouse is controlled:

- `onclick` - The mouse will be captured with a click inside the window.
- `onstart` - The mouse is captured immediately on start (similar to real DOS).
- `seamless` - The mouse will move seamlessly in and out of the window and
  cannot be captured.
- `nomouse` - The mouse is disabled and hidden without any input sent to the
  game.

The second value defines how middle-clicks are handled:

- `middlegame` - Middle-clicks are sent to the game (not used to uncapture the
  mouse).
- `middlerelease`- Middle-click will uncapture the mouse when windowed (not
  sent to the game).

For example:

``` ini
[sdl]
capture_mouse = onclick middlerelease
```

Will capture the mouse on the first click inside dosbox-staging's window, and a
middle-click will release the mouse. Note that the prior method to release the
mouse still works (pressing Ctrl-F10).

Note that dosbox-staging defaults to `seamless` mouse capture both to simplify
multi-tasking in windowed-mode and provide a frustration-free experience for
new users. However, some games and Windows 3.1 make their own adjustments to
the mouse position and will cause an offset-effect. In these cases, we
recommend switching to fullscreen (Alt-Enter) or configuring the mouse to capture
`onclick` or `onstart`.

*These options do not affect the mouse behavior in fullscreen (Alt-Enter), as the mouse is always captured.*

### <a name="nuked" href="#nuked">§</a> Nuked OPL v1.8

An excellent [OPL3][opl] "Nuked" emulator is used by default. This change
improves AdLib and SoundBlaster music emulation accuracy in many games.

Improved emulation quality comes at a cost of slightly higher CPU usage. For
the vast majority of users it will not be a problem, but e.g. Raspberry Pi
enthusiasts might prefer to switch to one of older emulators (see documentation
for `oplemu` in the configuration file).

[opl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YMF262

### <a name="config" href="#config">§</a> CONFIG command improvements

Built-in `CONFIG` shell command is old, but a little-known feature allowing
user to reconfigure dosbox-staging at runtime.  This is a nifty way to change
configuration using e.g. batch scripts based on user input.

#### Reloading key bindings

User can now change key bindings at runtime by loading them from a file:

``` shell
Z:\> config -set "sdl mapperfile=<path-to-file>"
```

#### Other new options (SVN)

Upstream added a number of features to this command, to list them all run:

``` shell
Z:\> config /?
```

### <a name="xdg" href="#xdg">§</a> Configuration file locations

#### Linux

The path for configuration files was changed according to
[XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg]. This means dosbox-staging is not going
to create configuration directories directly in your home directory any more.

Configuration files are created in:

``` text
~/.config/dosbox/
```

Users can override it via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, according to [spec][xdg].

[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

#### macOS

The path was slightly changed to avoid spaces in the default configuration
filename and group all configuration files in a single directory:

``` text
~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/
```

#### Windows

*No changes; the configuration files are created in:*

``` text
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\
```

### <a name="dynarec" href="#dynarec">§</a> 64-bit dynarec (SVN)

DOSBox had [dynamic recompilation][dynarec] support for a long time, but it was
limited only to 32-bit builds.  Support for 64-bit dynarec improves CPU
emulation speed and quality across the board - this is especially visible to
Linux and macOS users<sup>＊</sup>.

{{ youtube(id="9N-wXIamSh4", class="youtube") }}

Stargunner (1996) freeware; running on Linux x86\_64 via Boxtron

*Before 64-bit dynarec, this game had serious emulation problems resulting in
fluctuating emulation speed (sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow -
regardless of cycles settings). This game was designed to run with constant
70FPS and now it runs with constant 70FPS.*

[dynarec]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation

<sup>
＊ - dosbox-staging 0.75.0 stable Windows build is still 32-bit; Linux and
macOS builds are 64-bits.
</sup>

### <a name="cga" href="#cga">§</a> CGA improvements

[![CGA modes comparison](/cga-showcase-1-min.png)][cga4]

[cga4]:/cga-showcase-1.png

- *top-left: CGA, default palette*
- *top-right: CGA/mono, green tint selected*
- *bottom-left: CGA Composite, early model, default hue*
- *bottom-right: CGA Composite, late model, default hue*

#### CGA monochrome mode

Some [CGA][cga] games from 80's look much better with monochrome display;
this mode is designed to emulate such setup.

Use `machine = cga_mono`

*User can switch between green, amber, white, and paper-white tints at
runtime using&nbsp;F11.*

[cga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter

#### CGA Composite mode (SVN)

[Composite][comp] mode to  CGA emulation was introduced in SVN very
long time ago (in 2012), but was never back-ported to any stable release.
Most users know this mode from other DOSBox forks.

User can switch between Color and Composite mode, between CGA early and late
models, and adjust hue (all at runtime).

*The default keyboard binds for manipulating CGA modes conflict with
other essential binds. It's advisable to change them, if you plan to play
with this. The default key for turning on composite is F12.*

[comp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_artifact_colors

### <a name="glsl" href="#glsl">§</a> GLSL shader support (SVN)

[GLSL][glsl] shaders provide a HW-accelerated alternative to old (software-based)
DOSBox "scalers". They also allow for emulating CRT-like effects (e.g. scanlines or
shadow masks).

User can adjust shader setting in `render` section in the configuration file:

``` ini
[render]
glshader = sharp
```

It's also possible to provide your own shader implementations by placing `.glsl`
file in the configuration directory and selecting it in the configuration file, e.g.:

Place `test.glsl` file in the configuration directory:

``` ini
(Linux)   ~/.config/dosbox/glshaders/
(macOS)   ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/glshaders/
(Windows) C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\glshaders\
```

And select it in the configuration file:

``` ini
glshader = test.glsl
```

### <a name="date" href="#date">§</a> DATE and TIME commands (SVN)

Commands emulating DOS `DATE` and `TIME` utilities were added. User can
change date inside a dosbox:

``` shell
Z:\> date
Current date: Fri 05/01/2020
Type ´date MM-DD-YYYY´ to change.

Z:\> time
Current time: 11:08:23,34
```

This feature is useful for running old batch scripts and bypassing date checks
in some old software.

### <a name="overlay" href="#overlay">§</a> Mount overlay support (SVN)

This feature allows user to transparently redirect new and changed files
to a different location. The files in the overlay and normal drive are merged
on startup and kept up to date when the game writes something.

This feature is useful for redirecting save files or configuration files
to a different location (e.g. for backup or cloud saves).

Example usage:

``` text
Z:\> mount C real
Drive C is mounted as local directory real/

Z:\> mount C backup -t overlay
Overlay backup/ on drive C mounted.

Z:\> C:
C:\> echo foo > test.txt

C:\> type TEST.TXT
foo
```

File `TEST.TXT` is written to directory `backup`, and not to `real`.

## <a name="changelog" href="#changelog">§</a> Author Commits in Detail

| | Optimize xchg a bit. (jmarsh) |
| | Make value operator== const, add some limit checks in PrintConfigfile and related functions. Unify style a bit more. |
| | missing line ends and a warning fix |

| | Improve logging and OS X support (jmarsh). |
| | Some fixes to 4319 by jmarsh. |
| | Add OpenGL shader support. (patch by ny00123 and refined by jmarsh). Add several builtin ones that mimic the scalers and some extra. Thanks jmarsh |
| | Add LOGC to log cs:ip only. Modified version of patch 282 from Scott Percival. |
| | Increase limits a bit more for people who want to use that. |
| | Limit max software scaler line limit to a 4k monitor. (relevant for people who use larger scalers) |
| | Some graphics cards return a too small overlay when the size is larger than 1024. Fall back in that case. |
| | Rewrite video capturing and fix some endian issues with all captures as well. Thanks jmarsh |

Add define to turn off Pixel Buffer Object usage. (disabled by default) Add a way to specify the windowresolution as percentage of your current resolution. (This centers the window.) |
| | Log detected extensions and correct spacing. |
| | Force a flush, so the last data is there incase of a hard crash. |

| | Fix bug #520 |
| | a=a can trigger warnings as well. This should be hopefully do the trick. |
| | Remove some old code and do an a=a to trick a compiler in non-debug mode |

| | Make it easier to compile 64 builds with visual studio, (see comment for drawback). |
| | fix externals. |
| | Make frameskip an integer. |
| | Fix boundary checks for word/dword memory access. Speeds up dynamic 32 bit core a bit (thanks jmarsh). |
| | A little cleanup and small speed up (jmarsh) |
| | Change OpenGL drawing routine to draw one big oversized TRIANGLE instead of a QUAD in order to work around an Nvidia specific scaling bug. Fixes bug #515. |
| | Use fabsf when return value is a float. Small warning fix. |
| | Fix several logic errors with regards to deleted directories. Should fix that directories with the same length as a deleted directory had some small issues. Also blocks the creation of files in directories marked as deleted. Small speed up to MakeDir, so it doesn't rely on mkdir when a directory is created inside a deleted directory. |
| | - Fix url to forum. - Fix Bit8u instead of char weirdness for imageDisk (dreamer_) - Give device_t a virtual empty destructor so some warning program   doesn't go crazy. - Give the code that moves the Z drive its own function for readability. - Give sizes arrays default values again for warning program. - Rewrite IMGMOUNT in order to exit early for clarity and attempt   to group things together. |
| | Some more cleanups and memleak fixes. |
| | Pick some lowhanging fruit. (some memory leaks and unused variables) |
| | use delete instead of free, although this code is never really used, as the running process should have been replaced at that point. |
| | missed one |
| | These actually use float as input. |
