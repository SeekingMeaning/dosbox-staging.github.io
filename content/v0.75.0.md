## <a name="overview" href="#introduction">§</a> Overview of Changes

The **dosbox-staging 0.75** development cycle lasted roughly eight months
starting with the creation of the project mid-September 2019 and concluded
early May 2020.

### <a name="summary-new-features" href="#summary-new-features">§</a> Summary of New Features

- Migrated from Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) version 1.2.x to 2.0, which:
  - Enabled support for the Wayland display protocols
  - Enabled hardware-acceleration for OpenGL ES 1 and 2 devices on ARM
    platforms.
- Added support for CD-ROM Digital Audio (CD-DA) tracks compressed using the
  Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC), Opus, and Moving Picture Experts Group
  (MPEG) 2 Audio Layer III (MP3) audio codecs.
- Added hardware-accelerated pixel-perfect output.
- Added the ability to resize the window.
- Added the cycle-accurate Nuked Operator Type-L 3 (OPL3) emulator.
- Added Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) mono-color mode.
- Added phonebook support, to map modem phone-numbers to Internet hostnames.
- Added the AUTOTYPE command, which can perform scripted keyboard input on your
  behalf.

These are expanded upon in the following subsections.

### <a name="removed" href="#removed">§</a> Removed Features

- dosbox-staging does not run on Operating System/2 (OS/2) or derivatives.
- dosbox-staging does not run on Windows older than XP.
- Removed support for old DirectDraw (`ddraw`) output.  
  Use `output = texture`, `texture_renderer = directx11` instead.
- Removed support for old `overlay` output. Use any other output.
- Removed support for relative window size (`windowresolution = X%`).
- Removed support for 64-bit Zip Motion Blocks Video (ZMBV) codec (old 32-bit
  codec still works).
- Removed support for CD-DA playback from physical disks. It is
  still possible to install games distributed on CDs by mounting them as
  directories. See [#260][260].
- Removed CD-DA playback support for tracks using the Audio Interchange File
  Format[AIFF][aiff] audio codec.

### <a name="developer-features" href="#developer-features">§</a> Developmental Changes

- Migrated the DOSBox source from Apache's Subversion (SVN) software versioning
  and revision control system to the Git distributed version-control system
  with GitHub, preserving all publicly available project history.
  - Active SVN branch paths were imported as Git branches (named`svn/<name>`).
  - SVN tag paths were imported as Git lightweight tags (named
    `svn/<tag-name>`).
- Ongoing upstream SVN development work is being imported in a timely manner to
  the Git branch named `svn/trunk`.
- Began the migration to and allowance for C++11 language constructs.
- Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) system that builds on every code
  push, providing developers immediate feedback regarding build-success and
  warning-counts on:
  - Windows x86_64 using GCC 32 and 64-bit, Clang 32 and 64-bit, and
    VisualStudio 64-bit compilers
  - macOS x86_64 using GCC and Clang compilers
  - Linux x86_64, ARMv6, ARMv7, IBM LinuxONE, and IBM POWER8 platforms using
    various versions of GCC and Clang
- Added static analysis checks performed by LLVM's Clang, Synopsys's Coverity,
  and VIVA64's Program Verification Systems (PVS) Studio.
- Added dynamic analysis checked performed by Clang's undefined-behavior (UB)
  sanitizer and GCC's UB and Address sanitizers.
- The CI system includes gated checks that allow maintainers to focus on code
  functionality and correctness. These automated checks guarantee that new
  code:
  - builds clean on all supported platforms and compilers,
  - adds no new compiler warnings, and
  - adds no new static or dynamic analysis issues.
- Notable progress has been made in reducing the number of warnings and
  analysis issues flagged by these tools.
- *Windows*: the build-system was adjusted to allow easy compilation, without
  manual download or patching of dependencies. We use `vcpkg` to manage
  dependencies. The solution file was fixed to work with Visual Studio 2019.
- *Linux and macOS*: implemented a number of small build-system improvements.
- Automated the compilation of release-style builds against the latest master
  and feature branches. These not only save time for testers wanting to verify
  new features and bugfixes, but also ensures they're running builds compiled
  using would-be release settings.
- macOS release binaries are compiled with optimizations supporting Intel
  Nehalem-based instructions (and newer), as this matches the minimum hardware
  requirements of macOS Catalina.
- Release packages are scanned using up-to-date Antivirus software: ClamAV for
  Linux and macOS, and Windows Defender for Windows.
- The project has published a code of conduct along with clear contributing
  guidelines.

### <a name="known-issues" href="#known-issues">§</a> Known issues

- Inconsistent minimum window size with `windowresolution = resizable` when
  leaving fullscreen.
- Windows, macOS: Window content is not refreshed when resizing.
- Windows, macOS: Emulation stops when moving or resizing window.
- Linux: Wayland crashes (Wayland support is "experimental" at the moment)
- Linux: Splash screen is sometimes transparent or corrupted on KDE

We are extremely grateful for all contributions including the invaluable
improvements merged in from the DOSBox project. Thank you!

## <a name="new-features" href="#new-features">§</a> New Features in Detail

### <a name="sdl2" href="#sdl2">§</a> Upgrade to SDL 2.0

SDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase, which has been unmaintained
since 2013. SDL 2.0 supports more input devices; more output interfaces such as
Wayland, and OpenGLES 1 and 2; low-latency audio using OpenSL ES; and improves
cross-platform consistency.

The migration to SDL 2.0:

- dropped 3,211 lines of SDL 1.2 code in place of 1,664 lines, for just
  under a 50% reduction in code-size.
- eliminated several OS-specific branches and all SDL1-specific kludges.
- eased support for modern graphic APIs, and opened the field for new features
  and improvements.

One example includes a new `output` mode named `texture`, which uses SDL 2D
hardware-accelerated drawing API with one of platform-specific backends.

For example, Windows users can use:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = direct3d11
```

macOS users can try Metal:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = metal
```

and everyone can use OpenGL as texture backend:

``` ini
[sdl]
output           = texture
texture_renderer = opengl
```

Or just use `texture_renderer = auto` to pick the backend appropriate for your
Operating System.

## <a name="cdda" href="#cdda">§</a> Support FLAC, Opus, and MP3 CD-DA tracks

FLAC, Opus, and MP3 (as well as MP2 and MP1)-encoded audio can be `imgmount`ed
as CD-DA tracks in dosbox-staging, in addition to the usual WAV and Vorbis
tracks as supported by DOSBox. WAV support has also been expanded to include
Sony's Wave64 format.

All track types (including WAV and Vorbis) support various resolutions, such as
24 and 16-bit; sampling rates of 96, 88.2, 48, 44.1, 22.05, and 11.025 kHz; and
stereo or mono channel counts. These can be mixed-and-matched as desired to
optimize the encoding type for each track's content.

The following example CUE file shows to specify the new types:

``` cue
FILE "data.iso" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE1/2048
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track02.opus" OPUS
  TRACK 02  AUDIO
    PREGAP 00:02:00
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track03.flac" FLAC
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track04.mp3" MP3
  TRACK 04 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track05.w64" W64
  TRACK 05 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00

FILE "track06.ogg" OGG
  TRACK 06 AUDIO
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
```

For devices with sufficient storage, we recommend ripping your CD-ROM
audio to (lossless) FLAC tracks, and adding seek-points using:

``` shell
flac -8 --output-name=trackXY.flac trackXY.wav
metaflac --add-seekpoint=1s trackXY.flac
```

For portable or limited-storage devices, such as ARM single-board computers,
Opus provides state-of-the-art lossy compression that exceeds all other formats
including Apple's AAC and AAC High-Efficiency formats. Opus allows you to save
almost twice as much space as MP3 or Vorbis.

For example, tracks that contain mono-channel voice-only can be encoded with:

``` shell
opusenc --speech --bitrate 24 --downmix-mono trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

A bitrate between 54 and 70 is sufficient for mixed audio and simple music,
while a bitrate of 84 can be used for more complex audio tracks. Experient and
find that sweet spot!

``` shell
opusenc --bitrate 70 trackXY.wav trackXY.opus
```

If your CD-DA tracks are encoded at 48 kHz (which is Opus's defaults
internal rate), then feel free to configure `dosbox-staging`'s mixer rate
to 48 kHz, which ensures your CD-DA will not be resampled during playback
through your entire audio chain as your sound card, USB speakers, and HDMI
interface all (likely) use a digital audio converter (DAC) operating natively
at 48 kHz.

``` ini
[mixer]
rate = 48000
```

### <a name="pp" href="#pp">§</a> Pixel-perfect scaling mode

Pixel-perfect output scales the image by the largest integer multiplier
that fits within your monitor's native resolution. For example, given a
1920x1080 monitor resolution and a game requiring aspect-correction, each
of its 320x200 game requiring pixels would be scaled by 4x5, producting a
1280x1000 image. This preserves the original artwork without *any* edge
blurriness.

To enable pixel-perfect output, apply the following settings to the
indicated `[section]`s of your dosbox-staging configuration file, as
follows:

``` ini
[sdl]
fullscreen = true
output     = texturepp

[render]
scaler   = none
glshader = none
```

On 1080p screen it looks like this:

[![HoMM2](/homm2-pp-2x2-min.png)][homm2pp]

Heroes of Might and Magic 2 (1996)  
640x480 with [PAR][par] 1:1, upscaled 2x2

[par]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_aspect_ratio
[homm2pp]: /homm2-pp-2x2.png
[wolf3dpp]: /wolf3d-pp-4x5.png

### <a name="resizable" href="#resizable">§</a> Resizable window

Being able to click and drag to resize an application's window is not a
revolutionary feature by any measure, however it's a welcome addition for
`dosbox-staging`!

{{ youtube(id="9J2U-qFxE1E", class="youtube") }}

This feature is a work-in-progress: it's available on Linux by default, and can
be enabled for testing on Windows and macOS by setting the following (but note
that it does not yet work correctly on these systems):

``` ini
[sdl]
windowresolution = resizable
```

On all systems, the resizable window is only available for `output = opengl`
and `glshader = sharp`. Support will be expanded to more outputs and shaders in
the future versions.

### <a name="autotype" href="#autotype">§</a> AUTOTYPE command

`AUTOTYPE` is a command-line tool provided by `dosbox-staging` that performs
scripted keyboard entry into the running DOS program.

It can be used to reliably skip intros, answer Q&A style questions that some
games ask on startup, or conduct a simple demo.

Run this command to read usage:

``` shell
Z:> autotype -h
```

Some examples are listed in this [dedicated wiki article][autotype].

[autotype]: https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/wiki/AUTOTYPE-Candidates

### <a name="rdef" href="#rdef">§</a> Changed rendering defaults

The following default configuration settings were changed to improve the
out-of-the box experience for the majority of games running on modern hardware.

OpenGL is now used as the default rendering backend, targetting a 4:3 screen
aspect ratio, and using the `sharp` OpenGL shader to provide relatively sharp
pixels when full screen.

[![Battle Chess](/bc.png)](/bc.png)

### <a name="mouse" href="#mouse">§</a> Expand mouse control methods

The prior "autolocking" mouse option used by DOSBox has been renamed in
dosbox-staging to `capture_mouse`, now with two values defining how the mouse
behaves inside the emulator's window.

The first value defines how the mouse is controlled:

- `onclick` - The mouse will be captured with a click inside the window.
- `onstart` - The mouse is captured immediately on start (similar to real DOS).
- `seamless` - The mouse will move seamlessly in and out of the window and
  cannot be captured.
- `nomouse` - The mouse is disabled and hidden without any input sent to the
  game.

The second value defines how middle-clicks are handled:

- `middlegame` - Middle-clicks are sent to the game (not used to uncapture
  the mouse).
- `middlerelease`- Middle-click will uncapture the mouse when windowed (not
   sent to the game).

For example:

``` ini
[sdl]
capture_mouse = onclick middlerelease
```

Will make mouse cursor captured on the first click inside a dosbox window, and
release on middle-click.  Note that the old method of releasing cursor with
Ctrl-F10 still works.

Note that dosbox-staging defaults to `seamless` mouse_capture to simplify
multi-tasking in Windowed-mode and provide a frustration-free experience for
new users. However, some games and Windows 3.1 make their own adjustments to
the mouse position and will cause an offset-effect. In these cases, we
recommend switching to fullscreen (alt-enter) or setting the mouse to capture
`onclick` or `onstart`.

*These options do not affect mouse behavior in fullscreen; when switched to
fullscreen using Alt-Enter, mouse is always captured.*

### <a name="nuked" href="#nuked">§</a> Nuked OPL v1.8

An excellent [OPL3][opl] "Nuked" emulator is used by default. This change
improves AdLib and SoundBlaster music emulation accuracy in many games.

Improved emulation quality comes at a cost of slightly higher CPU usage. For
the vast majority of users it will not be a problem, but e.g. Raspberry Pi
enthusiasts might prefer to switch to one of older emulators (see documentation
for `oplemu` in the configuration file).

[opl]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YMF262

### <a name="config" href="#config">§</a> CONFIG command improvements

Built-in `CONFIG` shell command is old, but a little-known feature allowing
user to reconfigure dosbox-staging at runtime.  This is a nifty way to change
configuration using e.g. batch scripts based on user input.

#### Reloading key bindings

User can now change key bindings at runtime by loading them from a file:

``` shell
Z:\> config -set "sdl mapperfile=<path-to-file>"
```

#### Other new options (SVN)

Upstream added a number of features to this command, to list them all run:

``` shell
Z:\> config /?
```

### <a name="xdg" href="#xdg">§</a> Configuration file locations

#### Linux

The path for configuration files was changed according to
[XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg]. This means dosbox-staging is not going
to create configuration directories directly in your home directory any more.

Configuration files are created in:

``` text
~/.config/dosbox/
```

Users can override it via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, according to [spec][xdg].

[xdg]: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

#### macOS

The path was slightly changed to avoid spaces in the default configuration
filename and group all configuration files in a single directory:

``` text
~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/
```

#### Windows

*No changes; the configuration files are created in:*

``` text
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\
```


### <a name="dynarec" href="#dynarec">§</a> 64-bit dynarec (SVN)

DOSBox had [dynamic recompilation][dynarec] support for a long time, but it was
limited only to 32-bit builds.  Support for 64-bit dynarec improves CPU emulation
speed and quality across the board - this is especially visible to Linux and macOS
users<sup>＊</sup>.

{{ youtube(id="9N-wXIamSh4", class="youtube") }}

Stargunner (1996) freeware; running on Linux x86\_64 via Boxtron

*Before 64-bit dynarec, this game had serious emulation problems resulting in
fluctuating emulation speed (sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow - regardless of
cycles settings). This game was designed to run with constant 70FPS and now it
runs with constant 70FPS.*

[dynarec]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation

<sup>
＊ - dosbox-staging 0.75.0 stable Windows build is still 32-bit; Linux and
macOS builds are 64-bits.
</sup>

### <a name="cga" href="#cga">§</a> CGA improvements

[![CGA modes comparison](/cga-showcase-1-min.png)][cga4]

[cga4]:/cga-showcase-1.png

Maniac Mansion (1987), with forced CGA mode

- *top-left: CGA, default palette*
- *top-right: CGA/mono, green tint selected*
- *bottom-left: CGA Composite, early model, default hue*
- *bottom-right: CGA Composite, late model, default hue*

#### CGA monochrome mode

Some [CGA][cga] games from 80's look much better with monochrome display;
this mode is designed to emulate such setup.

Use `machine = cga_mono`

*User can switch between green, amber, white, and paper-white tints at
runtime using&nbsp;F11.*

[cga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter

#### CGA Composite mode (SVN)

[Composite][comp] mode to  CGA emulation was introduced in SVN very
long time ago (in 2012), but was never back-ported to any stable release.
Most users know this mode from other DOSBox forks.

User can switch between Color and Composite mode, between CGA early and late
models, and adjust hue (all at runtime).

*The default keyboard binds for manipulating CGA modes conflict with
other essential binds. It's advisable to change them, if you plan to play
with this. The default key for turning on composite is F12.*

[comp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_artifact_colors


### <a name="glsl" href="#glsl">§</a> GLSL shader support (SVN)

[GLSL][glsl] shaders provide a HW-accelerated alternative to old (software-based)
DOSBox "scalers". They also allow for emulating CRT-like effects (e.g. scanlines or
shadow masks).

User can adjust shader setting in `render` section in the configuration file:

```
[render]
glshader = sharp
```

It's also possible to provide your own shader implementations by placing `.glsl`
file in the configuration directory and selecting it in the configuration file, e.g.:

Place `test.glsl` file in the configuration directory:

```
(Linux)   ~/.config/dosbox/glshaders/
(macOS)   ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox/glshaders/
(Windows) C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\DOSBox\glshaders\
```
And select it in the configuration file:
```
glshader = test.glsl
```

### <a name="date" href="#date">§</a> DATE and TIME commands (SVN)

Commands emulating DOS `DATE` and `TIME` utilities were added. User can
change date inside a dosbox:

### <a name="overlay" href="#overlay">§</a> Mount overlay support (SVN)

This feature allows user to transparently redirect new and changed files
to a different location. The files in the overlay and normal drive are merged
on startup and kept up to date when the game writes something.

This feature is useful for redirecting save files or configuration files
to a different location (e.g. for backup or cloud saves).

Example usage:
```
Z:\>mount C real
Drive C is mounted as local directory real/
Z:\>mount C backup -t overlay
Overlay backup/ on drive C mounted.
C:
C:\>echo foo > test.txt
C:\>type TEST.TXT
foo
```
File `TEST.TXT` is written to directory `backup`, and not to `real`.
